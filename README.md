### A basic example, which explains PHPUnit with basic tests.

* Autoloading of classes and namespacing
* [Using Pear install of phpunit] (http://phpunit.de/manual/3.7/en/installation.html#installation.pear)


> phpunit --colors tests/Basic/CalculatorTest.php
> in phpunit.xml, bootstrap="./vendor/autoload.php" attribute specifies where the bootstrap
> file is located.

### TODO:

A lot more! stay tuned ;)

### Thank you!
